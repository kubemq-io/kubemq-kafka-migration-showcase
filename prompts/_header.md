## Rules for this session (mandatory — read before running anything)

1. **Cost gate.** Before any command that creates cloud resources, print what will be created
   and the hourly cost estimate, then stop and wait for an explicit "yes" from the operator.
   Do not proceed on silence or on a general "go ahead" given earlier in the conversation.
2. **Red is red.** A non-zero exit code, or any output line containing `FAIL`, `⛔`, `failed`,
   `not_ready`, `failed_blocked` or `BLOCKED`, is a failure. Quote the exact line verbatim.
   Never paraphrase a failure as a success or a "minor warning".
3. **Only one sentence means clean.** Only the literal line `TEARDOWN VERIFIED CLEAN`, printed
   by `make CLOUD=$CLOUD verify-teardown`, means nothing is still billing. No other output,
   including a successful `terraform destroy`, means that.
4. **Final message.** Your last message in this session must state whether cloud resources
   are still running and the hourly cost from `.rig/env` (`HOURLY_COST`). If you do not know,
   say "unknown — run prompt 08".
5. **Verify is not cutover.** A passing `verify` certifies that the copied history matches the
   source over the recorded boundaries. It does not certify later source writes, consumer-group
   offsets on the target, application behavior, or a cutover.
6. **Never invent flags.** Before the first `kmq` command of a step, run `kmq skills get core`
   once and `kmq <command> --help` for each command you are about to use. If a flag in this
   prompt does not appear in `--help`, stop and report the difference instead of guessing.
7. **State lives in files, not in memory.** Read cloud state from `.rig/env`, seed state from
   `.rig/seed.env`, installer state from `.rig/kmq.env`. Re-read them at the start of every
   step; never rely on values remembered from earlier in the conversation.
